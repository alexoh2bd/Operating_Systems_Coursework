The page size is 4096. I allocate 409600 bytes of memory, or 100 pages. I then set the entire allocated memory. When we call procstat before the allocation, we see under the RES column (the number of resident pages) that there are 14 pages under virtual memory range 0xe2d6000000 - 0xe2d6800000. The pointer is set at 0xe2d6212540 (within the range). After we allocate and set the memory, we see that in that same range of virtual memory, there are 115 resident pages, 101 more resident pages than before. Thus, the 409600 bytes of memory, the 100 pages, are now resident plus 1 extra page.
