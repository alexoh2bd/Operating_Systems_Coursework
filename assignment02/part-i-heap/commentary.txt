We malloc and set 200000000 bytes of memory at the pointer address 0x450f07600380. After we malloc, the end address at 0x450f06c00000 changed from 0x450f07400000 to 0x450f15600000. Malloc dynamically allocates memory in the heap, thus, this change address indicates that the data was pushed to the heap and starts at 0x450f15600000. The previous memory allocation would only have allowed for 8000000 bytes, this new mapping would allow for 245366784, enough for the new malloc.
