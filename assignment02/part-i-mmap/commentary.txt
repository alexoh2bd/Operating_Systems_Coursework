I find the mapped memory address by printing the memory address of mmap by calling mmap, printing virtual memory address of mmap, then cross referencing the physical address after calling procstat vm. I call procstat vm before mapping, after mapping, and after unmapping. The mapped address appears in the table only after mapped and is removed from the table when unmapped. mmap reserves space virtual address 0x40237000 to 0x40238000.
